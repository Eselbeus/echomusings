## Echo Musings

Echomusings.com is a music podcast website. This repository is the front end, built with React/Redux.

### Motivation

Some New York based musicians wanted to create a new podcast and news site to keep music fans updated on the music industry. Particularly in the era of Covid-19, it is important to be able to find newsworthy events and stay up to date with how musical artists are adapting.

### Tech/Framework

The front end of Echo Musings is built with React and Redux. It connects to a Ruby on Rails API. While most users of the site, perceive a news site with content, behind the scenes, there is a login system that uses the bcrypt and jwt gems for the content creators of the site to add new podcast episodes and articles. React Router is used to manage all of the different article pages.

### Build

The site is currently deployed using Netlify.
